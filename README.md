### 1. **Procedure to Import Data from CSV and XLSX Formats**

**Importing Data from a CSV File:**

To import data from a CSV file in R, you can use the `read.csv()` function.

```r
# Import data from a CSV file
data_csv <- read.csv("path/to/your/file.csv")

# Display the first few rows of the data
head(data_csv)
```

**Importing Data from an XLSX File:**

To import data from an Excel (XLSX) file, you can use the `readxl` package. First, install the package if you haven't already.

```r
# Install the readxl package (if not already installed)
install.packages("readxl")

# Load the readxl package
library(readxl)

# Import data from an Excel file
data_xlsx <- read_excel("path/to/your/file.xlsx")

# Display the first few rows of the data
head(data_xlsx)
```

**Example Output:**
```
# Example data output for CSV and XLSX import
# Assume the data has columns: ID, Name, Score
  ID   Name Score
1  1   John	85
2  2  Alice	90
3  3 Robert	78
```

### 2. **Evolution of R Programming Language**

R is a programming language and software environment used for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphical representation. Here's a brief overview of its evolution:

- **1993**: R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. It was designed as a free implementation of the S language developed at Bell Laboratories.
 
- **1995**: R became freely available under the GNU General Public License, attracting statisticians and data scientists.
 
- **2000s**: The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) was established, providing a repository for R packages. R's popularity grew significantly in academia and industry.
 
- **2010s**: The tidyverse collection of R packages, including `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, emerged, making data manipulation and visualization more intuitive.
 
- **Present**: R continues to evolve with regular updates, a strong community, and integration with other technologies like Python and big data platforms.

- **Freedom to Improve**: Users should have the right to improve R and release their improvements to the public.

These principles ensure that R remains a free and open-source software environment, fostering a collaborative and innovative community.

### 5. **Generating Even Numbers Using `for` Loops**

```r
# Simple code to generate even numbers from 1 to 20 using a for loop
for (i in 1:20) {
  if (i %% 2 == 0) {
	print(i)
  }
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[1] 2
[1] 4
[1] 6
[1] 8
[1] 10
[1] 12
[1] 14
[1] 16
[1] 18
[1] 20
```

### 6. **Determining Even or Odd Numbers Using `if-else`**

```r
# Simple code to check if a number is even or odd using if-else
num <- 7

if (num %% 2 == 0) {
  print("The number is even")
} else {
  print("The number is odd")
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[1] "The number is odd"
```

### 7. **Usage of `next` and `break` Statements in R**

- **`next` Statement**: Used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration.

- **`break` Statement**: Used to exit a loop immediately, regardless of the iteration count.

**Example Code:**

```r
# Example of next and break statements
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i == 5) {
	next  # Skip the rest of the loop when i is 5
  }
  if (i == 8) {
	break  # Exit the loop when i is 8
  }
  print(i)
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[1] 1
[1] 2
[1] 3
[1] 4
[1] 6
[1] 7
```

### 8. **Usage of Nested `if-else` Statements**

Nested `if-else` statements allow for more complex decision-making processes, where one `if-else` statement is placed inside another.

**Example Code:**

```r
# Simple code using nested if-else to categorize a number
num <- -5

if (num > 0) {
  if (num %% 2 == 0) {
	print("The number is positive and even")
  } else {
	print("The number is positive and odd")
  }
} else {
  if (num < 0) {
	print("The number is negative")
  } else {
	print("The number is zero")
  }
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[1] "The number is negative"
```

### 9. **Flowchart for `next` and `break` Statements**

**Flowchart Description**:
- **`next`**: The flow continues with the next iteration.
- **`break`**: The flow exits the loop immediately.

```plaintext
  +------------+
  | Start Loop |
  +-----+------+
    	|
    	v
+-------+-------+
| Condition Met?|
+-------+-------+
    	|
    	v
 +------+------+

### 1. **Create a New Dataset Using Data Frame, Vector, and Matrices**

**Creating a Vector:**

```r
# Vector of student scores
student_scores <- c(85, 90, 78, 92, 88)
print(student_scores)
```

**Creating a Matrix:**

```r
# Matrix of student scores across different subjects
student_matrix <- matrix(c(85, 90, 78, 92, 88, 80, 85, 75, 95, 82), nrow = 5, ncol = 2)
colnames(student_matrix) <- c("Math", "Science")
rownames(student_matrix) <- c("John", "Alice", "Bob", "Lisa", "Mark")
print(student_matrix)
```

**Creating a Data Frame:**

```r
# Data frame combining students' names, scores, and grades
student_data <- data.frame(
  Name = c("John", "Alice", "Bob", "Lisa", "Mark"),
  Score = student_scores,
  Grade = c("B", "A", "C", "A", "B")
)
print(student_data)
```

### 2. **Differences Between List and Data Frame**

- **List**:
  - A list is a collection of objects that can be of different types (e.g., numbers, strings, vectors, data frames, matrices).
  - Lists can contain elements of varying lengths and types.
  - Lists are more flexible but less structured.

  ```r
  # Example of a list
  example_list <- list(name = "John", age = 25, scores = c(85, 90, 78))
  ```

- **Data Frame**:
  - A data frame is a table-like structure where each column contains values of one variable, and each row is an observation.
  - All columns in a data frame are vectors of the same length, but they can be of different types (e.g., numeric, character).
  - Data frames are specifically structured for storing tabular data.

  ```r
  # Example of a data frame
  example_df <- data.frame(
	Name = c("John", "Alice", "Bob"),
	Age = c(25, 23, 22),
	Score = c(85, 90, 78)
  )
  ```

### 3. **R Code to Find Summary of Iris Data Set Row-Wise**

```r
# Load the iris dataset
data(iris)

# Find summary row-wise using apply function
row_summary <- apply(iris[, 1:4], 1, summary)
print(row_summary)
```

### 4. **R Code to Find Summary of Iris Data Set Column-Wise**

```r
# Find summary column-wise using apply function
col_summary <- apply(iris[, 1:4], 2, summary)
print(col_summary)
```

### 5. **Create a Matrix with Row and Column Names**

```r
# Create a matrix with custom row and column names
example_matrix <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
rownames(example_matrix) <- c("Row1", "Row2", "Row3")
colnames(example_matrix) <- c("Col1", "Col2", "Col3")
print(example_matrix)
```

### 6. **Code to Rearrange Variables in Iris Data Set**

```r
# Rearrange variables in the iris dataset (e.g., move 'Sepal.Width' to the first position)
rearranged_iris <- iris[, c("Sepal.Width", "Sepal.Length", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width", "Species")]
print(head(rearranged_iris))
```

### 7. **Advantages of `attach` and `detach` Commands in R**

- **`attach()`**:
  - Temporarily adds a data frame to the search path, allowing you to access variables in the data frame by name without using the `$` operator.
  - Useful for simplifying code when working with a specific data set.

  ```r
  attach(iris)
  summary(Sepal.Length)
  detach(iris)
  ```

- **`detach()`**:
  - Removes the attached data frame from the search path.
  - Prevents potential conflicts or errors when working with multiple data frames that have variables with the same names.

**Advantages**:
- **Simplicity**: Makes code more readable by avoiding repeated references to a data frame using the `$` operator.
- **Convenience**: Easier to perform operations on data frames with many variables.

### 8. **Uses of `apply` Function**

The `apply()` function in R is used to apply a function to the rows or columns of a matrix or data frame.

- **Syntax**: `apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...)`
  - `X`: The data (matrix or data frame).
  - `MARGIN`: 1 for rows, 2 for columns.
  - `FUN`: The function to apply.

**Example:**

```r
# Apply the mean function to each column in the iris dataset
col_means <- apply(iris[, 1:4], 2, mean)
print(col_means)
```

### 9. **Difference Between `lapply` and `sapply`**

- **`lapply()`**:
  - Applies a function to each element of a list or vector and returns a list.
  - Always returns a list, even if the result is of a single type.

  ```r
  # Example using lapply
  list_data <- list(a = 1:5, b = 6:10)
  lapply(list_data, sum)
  ```

- **`sapply()`**:
  - Similar to `lapply()` but attempts to simplify the result. It returns a vector or matrix when possible.
  - If the result can be simplified to a vector or matrix, `sapply()` will do so.

  ```r
  # Example using sapply
  sapply(list_data, sum)
  ```

**Difference**:
- **Output**: `lapply()` always returns a list, whereas `sapply()` tries to simplify the result into a vector or matrix.

### 10. **Summary Command in R**

The `summary()` function in R provides a summary of the given data. The type of summary depends on the data type:

- **For Numeric Data**: Returns minimum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, and maximum.
- **For Factor Data**: Returns the frequency of each factor level.
- **For Data Frames**: Returns summaries for each column.

**Example:**

```r
# Summary of the iris dataset
summary(iris)
```

**Expected Output**:

```plaintext
# Summary output for the iris dataset
 Sepal.Length	Sepal.Width 	Petal.Length	Petal.Width      	Species  
 Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100   setosa	:50  
 1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:2.800   1st Qu.:1.600   1st Qu.:0.300   versicolor:50  
 Median :5.800   Median :3.000   Median :4.350   Median :1.300   virginica :50  
 Mean   :5.843   Mean   :3.057   Mean   :3.758   Mean   :1.199             	 
 3rd Qu.:6.400   3rd Qu.:3.300   3rd Qu.:5.100   3rd Qu.:1.800             	 
 Max.   :7.900   Max.   :4.400   Max.   :6.900   Max.   :2.500  
```
